# Malware

## Project goals

You need to develop a ransomware that encrypt all the files with your extension and add a text file in the desktop with "All of your files have been encrypted,To unlock them contact me with your encryption code in this email@email.com, your encryption code is : {xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}". a random encryption code must be placed in the text file, you must use this encryption code to provide an decrypting program. a decryption program is generated for each victim using the number generated after the encrypting (the encryption code).

Your Malware and decryption program must be developed to work in Windows environment. The programs should not detect with Windows Defender and in more than 80% of Security vendors in virustotal https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload.

### What ransomware means

Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data, typically by encrypting it, until a sum of money (ransom) is paid. After the initial infection, the ransomware may display a message demanding payment to provide a decryption key that will unlock the encrypted data. Modern ransomware attacks can target both individuals and businesses and can involve complex payment demands, often through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to make the transactions more difficult to trace.

The goal of ransomware is to coerce victims into paying to restore access to their essential files or systems. It's important to note that even if a ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the data will be decrypted or that the system will be restored to its original state.

## Overview

This script is a Python utility for educational purposes that demonstrates the use of the `cryptography` library to encrypt files in a specified directory. Each file will be encrypted using a generated key, and the original files will be removed, leaving only the encrypted versions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `cryptography` Python module

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system and the required Python package:
`python --version`

`pip install cryptography`

## How it Works

The script generates a unique encryption key using the Fernet method.
This key is used to encrypt all files found within the specified directory.
The original files are deleted, and the encrypted files are saved with an .encrypted extension.
An information message is then saved to the desktop to notify the user of the encryption.

This project is made in VirtualBox using Windows 11 virtual machine.  
WARNING! Do not attempt to run outside of virtual machine, this is for your own good!

## Usage

### To encrypt files:

Run the script using Python:
`python malware.py`
Once executed, the script will encrypt all files in the testfolder directory, save the encryption key to encryption_key.key, and place an information message in a text file on the desktop.

### To unlock (decrypt) your files:

Ensure that the decryptor.py script is in the same directory as the encryption_key.key file.
Run the decryptor script using Python:
`python decryptor.py`
The script will ask for the path to the encrypted files and the location of the encryption_key.key.
Provide the required paths, and the script will decrypt all files in the specified directory, restoring them to their original state.
Please note that you must have the correct encryption_key.key that was used to encrypt the files. Without this key, decryption is not possible.

### Additional Information

This project includes an executable version of the `malware.py` script, which was compiled using PyInstaller for ease of distribution and execution on Windows systems. Below are the steps taken to compile the script into an executable:

- PyInstaller was installed using the pip package manager with the following command: `pip install pyinstaller`
- The malware.py script was then converted into a standalone executable file using PyInstaller.
- To ensure that the cryptography package is correctly included in the standalone executable, the `--hidden-import` flag was used when running PyInstaller. The command for compiling the script into an executable with all necessary imports was:
  `pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-imports=cryptography malware.py`
- After the build process completed, the resulting `malware.exe` file was located in the `dist` directory. This file was then moved to the malware folder for use.
